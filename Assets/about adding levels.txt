- New levels can be created by duplicating the template the prefab at \Assets\Prefabs\Levels\Template-PiecePrefabs 
and designing the duplicate.

- Newly created levels can be added to the Game Manager object's LevelManager script; into the LevelPieces array.

- Levels can be edited from their individual prefabs.

- All levels have the same LevelRoad and LevelEnd prefabs. Edit those to make changes on every level at once.

- The level width can be edited but do not modify the height of the levels since the LevelManager assumes all levels are at at fixed length.

- All available interactable game elements are present in the template prefab. Their parameters, trigger and target points can be 
modified as the level designer desires.

- Modify the width parameter on Player only when you update the width of the road or the Player.
